//
// Example 4 - Paint
//
// A simple drawing program.  Click a color in the palette
// to select it.  Left-click drag in the canvas area to draw.
//
// Exercises:
// 1. Add an 's' shortcut key that saves the image to the deskop (using the SaveImage() function)
// 2. Allow a right-click drag to "erase" (by always drawing in Black)
// 3. Extend your right-click interaction to allow for two currently-selected colors: a "foreground"
//    and "background" color, instead of right-click always being black
// 4. Ensure the spacebar shortcut also uses the current background color when it clears the canvas
//
